## [2025-12-08] - Game Script Projections

### Added
- **Top Stacks - Game Script Analysis**:
  - Game script calculation based on spread, total, and implied team total
  - Blowout probability using normal distribution (std dev ~13.5 points)
  - 5 game script categories:
    - 🔥 Blowout (Fav): Large favorite (spread >7)
    - ❄️ Blowout (Dog): Large underdog (spread <-7)
    - ⚡ Shootout: High-scoring game (total ≥50)
    - ⚖️ Competitive: Close game (spread -7 to +7, total 44-50)
    - 🛡️ Low-Scoring: Defensive battle (total <44)
  - Position-specific script impact multipliers:
    - RB: +20% as favorite, -15% as underdog
    - QB: +15% in shootouts, +10% as underdog
    - WR: +12% in shootouts, +8% as underdog
    - TE: +8% in shootouts, +5% competitive
    - DST: +25% as underdog, +15% low-scoring
  - New columns in boom/bust view:
    - `Script_Cat`: Game script category with emoji
    - `Blowout_Prob%`: Probability of 14+ point margin
    - `Script_Impact`: Position-specific multiplier (0.80-1.25)
  - Game script filter (multi-select by category)
  - Color-coded game scripts (purple=shootout, green=fav, blue=dog, yellow=competitive, gray=low-scoring)
  - Script impact color gradient (green=positive, yellow=neutral, red=negative)

### Changed
- Player boom/bust analysis now factors game environment into ceiling calculations
- Added scipy.stats dependency for normal distribution calculations

## [2025-12-08] - Leverage Enhancements & DST Fixes

### Added
- **Top Stacks - Leverage Enhancements**:
  - Leverage filter slider (filter by leverage % range)
  - "Sort by Leverage" checkbox for quick identification of high-leverage plays
  - Leverage category column (`Lev_Cat`) with visual labels: 🔥 High, ⚡ Medium, ✓ Low, ⚠️ Negative
  - Color-coded leverage categories (green/yellow/orange/red)
  - Leverage insights summary metrics (counts by category)
  - Leverage guide caption (>10% = High, 5-10% = Medium, <5% = Low)
  - Multi-criteria filtering (Position + Salary + Ownership + Leverage)

- **Top Stacks - DST hits_4x Fix**:
  - Load `Weekly_DST_Stats.csv` for DST historical data
  - Calculate `hits_4x` from DST stats (previously showing 0 for all DST)
  - Position-aware lookup (DST uses Weekly_DST_Stats, others use Weekly_Stats)

### Changed
- Enhanced boom/bust view with comprehensive leverage filtering and sorting

---

## [2025-12-08] - Earlier

### Added
- `claude.md` files in all subdirectories for AI context
- `plan.md` for tracking future enhancements
- `changelog.md` for version tracking

### Changed
- **ROO Simulator**: Now uses FULL SEASON data for all metrics (mean, std, min, max)
  - Previously used 8-week lookback for mean/std, causing inconsistency
  - `hist_max_fpts` (max_dk) now shows true season ceiling
  - `hist_mean_fpts` (avg_dk) now shows true season average
  - Coefficient of variation now mathematically consistent

### Removed
- Consolidated 12 extraneous docs from `/docs` into `claude.md` files:
  - MODULARIZATION_SUMMARY.md
  - UNIFIED_APP.md
  - DST_INTEGRATION.md
  - CORRELATION.md
  - top_stacks_stokastic.md
  - sims_tool_instructions.md
  - MODULAR_REORGANIZATION.md
  - MODULAR_STRUCTURE.md
  - modular_instructions.md
  - PIPELINE_SIMPLIFICATION.md
  - OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
  - NEW_DATA_STRUCTURE.md

## [2025-12-07]

### Added
- **Lineup Simulator**: DST name standardization for lineup parsing
  - Maps DraftKings full names ("Cleveland Browns") to abbreviated format ("Browns")
  - Fixes "player not found" errors when importing lineups with DST
  - Applied same 32-team mapping used in ROO simulator

- **Boom/Bust Tool**: Salary and ownership filter sliders
  - Salary range slider ($min-$max, $100 steps)
  - Ownership percentage slider (0%-max%, 0.5% steps)
  - 4-column filter layout for better UX
  - Multi-criteria filtering (position + salary + ownership)

### Fixed
- Top Stacks tool position filtering (variable shadowing bug)
- QB-RB correlation display logic
- None value formatting in correlation output

### Changed
- Stack generation optimization: Pre-load Weekly_Stats.csv once (80%+ faster)
- Eliminated 4,500+ redundant file reads in stack combinations
