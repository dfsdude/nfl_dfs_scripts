About Our NFL DFS Boom-Bust Tool for Week 1
In all DFS sports, being able to compare the strength of a player each day versus their popularity is key to success. For each player, we calculate the standard deviation based on a variety of factors and use that to calculate the ceiling (75th-percentile performance) the floor (25th-percentile performance) and the probability that they will bust (not meeting value) or boom (large field GPP winning player). Combining these metrics, you will be able to gain an edge on everyone by identifying under-owned or over-owned players.

The Boom and Bust percentages are determined by the probability that each player will reach a target score determined by position and salary. For instance on DK the average points/$1k for QB's is about 3x while other positions about 2.4x. On top of that on a full slate your team has to overperform by about 100 points, which is divvied up across the 9 roster spots.

Boom% is the probability of achieving positional target score based on chance of being the top 1 QB, top 2 RB, etc. Bust% is the probability of failing to achieve positional value – 2 fpts. Ceiling is the 75th percentile performance and the Floor is the 25th percentile performance. Finally, Optimal% is the probability that player will be in perfect lineup that slate.
